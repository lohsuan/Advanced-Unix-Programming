# Race & Reentrant + Homework #2

This lab aims to investigate possible race or reentrant errors from multithreaded programs. Please read the codes and solve the challenges available on the two challenge servers.

Also, as we introduced in our last lecture, we allocate a few points for the assembly challenges you may have already solved in the past week.

## Challenge #1

The challenge server #1 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 10931
```

Once you have connected to the challenge server, please dump the content of the `flag` file on the server.

We provide the source code of the challenge server for your reference [[view](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab04/unixfortune.c)].

## Challenge #2

The challenge server #2 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 10932
```

Once you have connected to the challenge server, please ask the challenge server to retrieve the secret from localhost:10000.

We provide the source code of the challenge server for your reference [[view](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab04/flagsrv.cpp)].
